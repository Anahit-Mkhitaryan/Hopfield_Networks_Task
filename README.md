# Hopfield Networks | Scheduling CS140

This repository contains the implementation of Hopfield Networks applied to Unconstrained Examination Timetabling.

## Description

Hopfield Networks are a form of recurrent artificial neural network that can serve as content-addressable memory systems with binary threshold nodes. This project demonstrates the use of Hopfield Networks for solving the unconstrained examination timetabling problem, which involves scheduling exams in such a way that no constraints are violated.

## Features

- Implementation of Hopfield Networks in Java
- Application of Hopfield Networks to solve the examination timetabling problem
- Example datasets and results

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Anahit-Mkhitaryan/Hopfield_Networks_Task.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Hopfield_Networks_Task
    ```
3. Compile the Java code:
    ```bash
    javac -d bin src/*.java
    ```
4. Run the program:
    ```bash
    java -cp bin Main
    ```

## Usage

1. Provide the input data for the examination timetable.
2. Run the main program to generate the timetable using Hopfield Networks.
3. Review the generated timetable and evaluate its effectiveness.
